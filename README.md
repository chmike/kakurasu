Program solving random kakurasu
===============================

A kakurasu is an n rows by m colums grid puzzle. The goal of the puzzle is to determine the black 
or white color of all cells by using the sums of weight of black cells in all rows and columns. 
The weight is a number from 1 to n. 
 
The image bellow shows a solved kakurasu. The numbers on the top and left sides are the row and 
column weights. The numbers on the right and at the bottom are the sums of weights of black cells.

Solving algorithm
-----------------

Each sum has a limited set of possible weight combinations. From this set of possible solutions we can 
deduce that some cells must be white and others must be black because they are respectively white or 
black in all solutions. The image below illustrate the deduction we can make from the sum 9. A cell 
color is grey when itâ€™s color is left unknown by the deduction.

Once we deduced the color of a cell, we can prune solutions with an incompatible color from the row or 
column containing the cell. By repeating the deduction and pruning operations, we can deduce the color 
of the grid cells. This deduction process ends when the color of all cells has been determined, or when 
no new deductions can be made. In the later case we are left with cells of unknown color. This means 
that there are multiple solutions where the cells of unknown color are black and white.

To find the different solutions, we solve by assign the color white to a cell of unknown color, and 
again by assigning the color black to that cell. This can be repeated as needed until the color of all 
cells has been determined for all solutions.



This program was implemented as a [response](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59126550/75517) to a stack 
overflow question. I had a lot of fun finding and implementing the algorithm.
